# Sensor_Buzzer
Having a buzzer ring when the sensor detects something within a certain distance using a microcontroller

Everything besides the Sensor_Buzzer file was not created by me 

Need to add circuit diagram for wiring and parts

To run open the Sensor_Buzzer file in Arduino IDE and upload to microcontroller with other files in a folder
